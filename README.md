## About

Now, most of list fields (channels, videos, etc.) is Russian "trash" content.

Currently, I have no mention of why this or that content is blocked.
But if you create an issue or send a pull request, the reason will be added to the `reasons.txt`.

0. Install BlockTube for your browser.
1. Download `1nfdev_blocktube_backup.json`.
2. Open BlockTube settings.
3. Click on `Import` and choice `1nfdev_blocktube_backup.json`.
4. Done!
